# Mode

Distributed [Node](http://nodejs.org/) module repository.

Mode aims to provide three things:

- Provide a simple command line tool for installing and managing node modules.
- Distribute hosting of modules -- each registered module is individually maintained and developed by it's author(s).
- Provide a standard index of known modules.

If you are a developer of a node module, you might be interested in reading the [Mode maintainers' guide](http://github.com/rsms/mode/blob/master/doc/maintainers-guide.md).


## Example use

This example assumes you have cloned mode and added the `bin` directory to your `PATH`.

    $ mode search crypto
