# Mode

Distributed [Node](http://nodejs.org/) module repository.

Mode aims to provide three things:

- Provide a simple command line tool for installing and managing node modules.
- Distribute hosting of modules -- each registered module is individually maintained and developed by it's author(s).
- Provide a standard index of known modules.

If you are a developer of a node module, you might be interested in reading the [Mode maintainers' guide](http://github.com/rsms/mode/blob/master/doc/maintainers-guide.md).


## Example use

This example assumes you have cloned mode and added the `bin` directory to your `PATH`.

    $ mode search crypto
    math/crypto â€” OpenSSL based Hashing, Signing and Verifying.
    $ mode install crypto
    Installing crypto@master
      Fetching crypto@master from git://github.com/waveto/node-crypto.git
      Configuring crypto@master
      Building crypto@master
      Activating crypto@master
    Installed crypto@master
    $ mode update
    Already up-to-date.
    $

## Installing

Mode is installed by cloning this repository and can be placed wherever you want.

    $ git clone git://github.com/rsms/mode.git

Mode will put all activated modules in the "active" subdirectory. If you installed mode in your home directory, active modules will be found in `~/mode/active`. To make node find modules installed and activated by mode, you need to tell node about this path. There are many ways of doing so, but the recommended way is by using `~/.node_libraries`:

    $ ln -s mode/active .node_libraries

Now node will find all modules you install and activate using mode. You can of course still put other modules, not managed by mode, into your .node_libraries directory.

Also, add the `mode` program to your `PATH`. One way of doing so would be:

    $ ln -s mode/bin/mode ~/bin/mode

Assuming `~/bin` is a directory and already in `PATH`.


## Requirements

- [node](http://nodejs.org/) `>=0.1.30`
- [git](http://git-scm.com/) `>=1.6`

Yup, that's it.
