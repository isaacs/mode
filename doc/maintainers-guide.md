# Mode maintainers' guide

Mode provides a "blessed" and structured index of module *control files*. A *control file* is a node script which at minimum defines at least one source location for the module.

> **Note:** This documentation is a draft. Some parts are missing and some parts might be outdated.

## Control file

Let's have a look at an example *control file*:

    // example/bar.js
    info.description = "An example module";
    info.github = "foo/bar";

This file provides information about the "bar" module in the "example" category. It uses the short-hand `github` property to define its source and web site. If the source is not on github, the repo and url could be written directly like this:

    // example/bar.js
    info.description = "An example module";
    info.repo = "git://some.domain/~foo/git/bar.git";
    info.url = "http://baz.com/code/bar.html";

In other words, the actual module is located *outside* of mode. Mode does only provide the means to find and install the correct ones.

A *control file* is exposed to a set of script-local symbols:

- `info`, `this`, `exports` -- The module information object (alias for `module.info`).
- `module` -- The Module object. (instance of `mode.Module`).
- `require` -- Standard node `require` function.
- `__filename` -- Absolute filename of the current *control file*.
- `__dirname` -- Absolute filename of the parent directory of the current
  *control file*.


### Versioning

Mode takes a slightly different approach to versioning than most other package or module manager. Multiple versions of a module can be installed in parallel but more importantly, there is a notion of "latest version" ("master" branch in git-based repos). By default (if no explicit version is specified) a module is installed and keep up to date for it's "master" version. This means that ***control files* does not need to be changed for updates to propagate**. It's up to the user (and other modules dependencies) to choose one or more explicit versions.

However, a control file can specify a custom repository ref from which to sync source and updates. This gives you as a module maintainer great flexibility as you can setup a "stable" branch in which you keep your quality-assured and tested module while keeping daily development in the master branch.

Revisiting our `example/bar` control file:

    // example/bar.js
    info.description = "An example module";
    info.github = "foo/bar";
    info.repoRef = "stable";

In this example, mode will keep users' default installations of your module in sync with the "stable" branch of your repo.

> Note that a user can override this using the `--repo-ref` flag or `@ref` suffix to `mode install`.


### Configuration

Most modules do not require manual configuration. If you do _not_ specify a "product", your module directory will be treated as the actual module. That is, if your module is called `example/bar` and checked out to `/cache/example/bar`, will be symbolically linked to `/library/bar` (simplified -- in reality its namespaced with ref(s)).

#### Custom configuration

Normally you only need to configure (or specify) the "product" -- the file or directory which will house your module.

Let's revisit our dear `example/bar` control file with the addition of "product":

    // example/bar.js
    info.description = "An example module";
    info.github = "foo/bar";
    info.product = "lib/bar.js";

This tells mode that `lib/bar.js` should be activated (symlinked into your library directory). Paths are relative to the module source root.

> The name of the symlink will always be named after your module (e.g. "foo" in our example) no matter what the file is called in the repo.

#### Advanced configuration

During the *configuration* step a module control script can execute custom code by registering a `configure` member in it's `info`.

    info.description = "An example module";
    info.github = "foo/bar";
    info.configure = function(options, jobs, cl) {
      // <this>    will refer to the module instance
      // <options> is a union of command line options and internally 
      //           implied options
      // <jobs>    is a job queue on which you can queue async jobs which will
      //           be executed in an orderly, sequential fashion.
      jobs.push(function(jobdone){
        fs.readFile(__filename, function(err, content) {
          // do something awesome
          jobdone(err);
        })
      });
    }

> Note: Configure code should avoid using synchronous (blocking) function calls. When the job is completed, call `jobdone`.


### Building

Currently mode supports configuring and building `node-waf`-based native code modules. If a `wscript` file is found in the root of the module source, or if the `info.wscript` property is set, the configure and build steps will invoke `node-waf configure` and `node-waf build`, respectively.


## Installation steps

When a module is installed or updated (i.e. `mode install bar`) the following steps are taken in order:

1. [**load**] -- The module *control file* is loaded and executed. This step 
   is not visible to the user.

3. **fetch** -- The module source is either cloned/downloaded or pulled/patched.

4. **configure** -- The module is *configured*.

5. **build** -- The module is built, if applicable.

6. **activate** -- The module is activated (symbolic links are created/replaced
   within the local library directory).

If an error occurs, the process is aborted and the user is presented with a description of the error.

## Uninstallation steps

When a module is uninstalled (i.e. `mode uninstall bar`) the following steps are taken in order:

1. **deactivate** -- The module symlink is removed from the `active` directory.

2. **clear** -- The installed module is removed from the `active` directory, (effectively removing everything added by mode).

As a side note, the `deactivate` command performs the same task, except from purging the actual checkout (the module will be left in the `installed` directory and can later be activated using the `activate` command).
